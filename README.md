Cypress PSoC FreeRTOS Demo
==========================
This projects holds example projects to use [FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/) in [PSoC Creator](http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-creator-integrated-design-environment-ide) for the Cypress Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC).

## Suported devices
The following devices are supported in these examples:
-  Cypress [PSoC 4](http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-4) (Cortex M0)  
-  Cypress [PSoC 5](http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-5lp) (Cortex M3)

## Motivation
In a private project I wanted to use FreeRTOS in my system and I was ristricted to a [PSoC](http://www.cypress.com/products/32-bit-arm-cortex-m-psoc) chip from Cypress. For this reason I implemeted this for a PSoC 4 and PSoC 5 chip.

## Requirements
- GNU Tools ARM Embedded
- [PSoC Creator](http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-creator-integrated-design-environment-ide)

## Setup
Just download and open the `.cywrk` file with PSoC Creator.

## Tests
This software is tested with PSoC Creator 3.3 CP1 (3.3.0.410) And with FreeRTOS V8.2.2.

## Devices
The following dev kits were used to test the projects.
